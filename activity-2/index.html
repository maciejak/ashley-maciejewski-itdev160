          <p>"Sometimes, Roger Ebert is exposed to <em>bad</em> movies.</p>
          <p>When that happens, it is his duty -- if not necessarily his pleasure -- to report them (fairly, accurately) as he sees them. Whether they're so bad they're funny, so bad they're not funny, or so unfunny they're not funny, he must critique them.</p>
          <p>From bad Elvis to Deuce Bigalow, these are excerpts from reviews of some of the worst movies he's ever seen. It's not just their measly ratings -- from zero to 1.5 stars -- but what Ebert has to say about them that really conveys their true <em>awfulness</em>."</p>
