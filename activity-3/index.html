            <h2>Product Description: </h2>
            <h3>AC/DC Would Be Proud</h3>
            <p>The Beach Behemoth was first recorded in writing by Spanish
              conquistadors in 1521, as they observed several native populations
              worshipping the gargantuan orbs as minor sun gods. In awe of the
              Behemoth's remarkable stature, the conquistadors named it El
              Gigante. Then they all had a rockin' beach party.
            <h3>Why You'll Love It</h3>
            <p>Measuring a ridiculous 12 feet from pole to pole, the Beach
              Behemoth is the largest beach ball you might ever behold.
              And despite its gargantuan proportions, it soars through the air
              and floats on water just like a regular beach ball, only it is
              much, much gianter. Made of thick, 30mil vinyl, don't be afraid
              to get a little rough—the Behemoth can handle it. We recommend
              you inflate your Behemoth with an electric pump. The only human
              to ever attempt manual inflation is our intern, Stefano, and
              he's still blowing to this day.</p>

                <h3>&#9733;	&#9733; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734; A fun way to ruin a
                  weekend and blow 100 bucks.</h3>
                  <p class="author">Reid Hamlin | February 3, 2018</p>
                  <p>We took this ball to the beach and after close to 2 hours
                    to pump it up, we pushed it around for about 10 fun filled
                    minutes. That was when the wind picked it up and sent it
                    huddling down the beach at about 40 knots. It destroyed
                    everything in its path. Children screamed in terror at the
                    giant inflatable monster that crushed their sand castles.
                    Grown men were knocked down trying to save their families.
                    The faster we chased it, the faster it rolled. It was like
                    it was mocking us. Eventually, we had to stop running after
                    it because its path of injury and destruction was going to
                    cost us a fortune in legal fees. Rumor has it that it can
                    still be seen stalking innocent families on the Florida
                    panhandle. We lost it in South Carolina, so there is
                    something to be said about its durability.
                <h3>&#9733;	&#9733; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734; You don’t really
                  appreciate just how large a 12 ft beach ball is until it is
                  rolling like crazy across the backyard</h3>
                  <p class="author">Aurora Porter | April 21, 2018</p>
                  <p>We blew this up in our backyard and it is as large as it is
                    advertised. You don’t really appreciate just how large a
                    12 ft beach ball is until it is rolling like crazy across
                    the backyard, bowling over small children and getting
                    launched up into the air. Do not buy if you live anywhere
                    that might be described as “windy” or “gusty” or even “just
                    a little breezy”. Light enough to reach "Holy God! Where's
                    it going to land?" altitudes. A 12ft beach ball can destroy
                    a lot of potato salad, let me tell you! This year’s family
                    reunion will forever be remembered as the year that mistakes
                    were made.</p>

                  <p>100 well spent for 15-20 minutes of fun knocking people
                    down and causing destruction where ever ur went until it hit
                    a sharp edge on a pole and popped multiple times we kept
                    repairing it with tape and it actually worked all in all it
                    was still worth the 100 bucks of laughs</p>
